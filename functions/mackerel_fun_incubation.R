# Incubation 

# Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) egg incubation as functions of sea water temperature (C)

# All incubation equations take the form of power functions: I = a*temperature^b; log(I) = log(a) + b * temperature); I = exp(b * log(temperature) + a)
# These equations are simplifications of equations proposed by Belehradex (1930, 1935) whereby I = a*(T-a)^ b and not I = a*T^b

# For the Northwest Atlantic mackerel, the mean temperature of the first 10 m of the sea surface are used as derived from CTD casts.

#' Mackerel egg incubation - Worley 1933 - NWA mackerel
#' The  spawning  season  of  the  mackerel  at  Woods  Hole,  during  1931 and  1932  embraced  the  period  from  about  May  15  to  June  20.  The sea  water  temperature  at  Woods  Hole  during  this  period  increased from  about  11.5  ?  to  18?C. Early  June  experiments  demonstrated  that  mackerel  eggs  fail  to cleave  normally  at  temperatures  as  low  as  10  ?,  although  they  develop in  a  typical  manner  at  11?C.  Embryos  which  were  held  at  a  thermostat  temperature  of  8  ?  displayed  no  development  whatever,  although eggs  were  kept  under  observation  at  this  temperature  for  approximately  48  hours.  The  nuclei  of  eggs  held  at  8.5  ?  underwent  division as  many  as  four  times,  so  that  16  nuclei  resulted  in  each  egg,  but  there was  no  cytoplasmic  division.

#' Abstract:
#' 1. Mackerel egg development was followed to hatching at constant temperatures of 10 degrees , 11 degrees , 12 degrees , 13 degrees , 14 degrees , 15 degrees , 16 degrees , 17 degrees , 18 degrees , 19 degrees , 20 degrees , 21 degrees , 22 degrees , and 24 degrees C. Experiment showed that typical development could be realized only between 11 degrees and 21 degrees . 2. The length of the developmental period increases from 49.5 hours to 207 hours when the temperature is lowered from 21 degrees to 10 degrees C. 3. The calculated micro for the development of the mackerel egg is about 19,000 at temperatures above 15 degrees and approximately 24,900 for temperatures below 15 degrees C. 15 degrees is, apparently, a critical temperature for this process. 4. The calculated values of micro for eight stages of development preceding hatching, i.e. 6 somites, 12 somites, 18 somites, 24 somites, three-quarters circles, four-fifths circles, five-sixths circles, and full circles, are essentially the same as the micro's for hatching, indicating that the rate of differentiation up to hatching is governed by one process throughout. Critical temperatures for these stages approximate 15 degrees . 5. The total mortality during the incubation period was least at 16 degrees C. where it amounted to 43 per cent. At temperatures above and below this there was a steady increase in the percentage of mortality which reached 100 per cent at 10 degrees and 21 degrees .
